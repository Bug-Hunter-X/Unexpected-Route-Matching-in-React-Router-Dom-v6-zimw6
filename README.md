This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using React Router Dom v6: unexpected route matching behavior, particularly with routes containing parameters and paths with or without trailing slashes.

The bug is showcased in `App.js`, highlighting how incorrect route matching can lead to unexpected page renders.

The solution provided in `AppSolution.js` addresses this by implementing a more robust route configuration and handling of trailing slashes, ensuring consistent and predictable routing behavior.
